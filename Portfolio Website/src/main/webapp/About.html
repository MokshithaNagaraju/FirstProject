	<h2>Hey there! I'm Mokshitha</h2>
	
	<h4> currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications (BCA)
	 with a passion for web development.</h4>
	
	
	
	 <h4>Coming from a solid educational background with a stellar <b>10-points</b> score in my <b>10th grade from
	  Bhashyam School</b> and achieving <b> 83.3%</b> in<br> my <b>Intermediate</b> at <b>Sri Chaithanya Junior College</b>,
	   I've always had a knack for academics.</h4>
	   
	    
	    
	    <h4> I've delved into various aspects of computer science, honing my skills in<b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
	     Java, C, C++, data structures, and SQL.</b></h4>
	     
	     
	     
	     <h4> I find solace and excitement in pursuing a diverse range of hobbies.
	      Whether it's experimenting with<b> new recipes in the kitchen,<br></b> losing myself
	       in the <b>rhythm of dance,</b> expressing emotions through <b>songs</b>, or engaging in friendly 
	       matches on the field, <br>I believe in <b>living life to the fullest.</b><br></h4>
	      <h4> One of my favorite pastimes is designing web pages, where I get to blend my creativity
	        with technical prowess to craft visually stunning and functional interfaces.
	         It's a space where I can unleash my imagination and bring ideas to life,
	          one pixel at a time.</h4>
	          
	          <h3>I'm thrilled about the journey ahead, eager to learn, grow, and make meaningful 
	          contributions to the world of technology. <br>
	          Let's connect and embark on this adventure together!</h3>
